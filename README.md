Trying to solve all graph related problems from CSES

Just putting a quote I vaguely remember:

A boy and a horse are in the middle of forest, 
boy says " I don't think we can make through this, looking at thick deep trees". 
Horse replies: "Are you certain about your next step ? "
boy says: " Yes"
horse : " Then take it "

Moral: dont overthink about your present situation and your future, if u r clear about what to do now, and u know how to do it, just keep doing it , 

Will try to solve as many graph problems as possible :
